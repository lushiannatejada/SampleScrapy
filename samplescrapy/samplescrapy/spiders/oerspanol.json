The student will then support their opinions with research and tie their opinion with their resources in an informative and persuasive letter to their local Congressional representative. This letter will then be translated into Spanish and both copies will be sent to the representatives of their district. They will also be asked to create and share with the class a video of their own stances and reasoning. \u00a0StandardsLearning ObjectiveAssessmentLearners use the target language to expand their knowledge of and make connections among multiple content areas\u00a03.5.2- Implement content area concepts and skills through relevant activities- Students will identifyfind three different factual pieces of evidence - Students will compose professional persuasive letters in both Spanish and English- Students will create a 2-3 minute video that shows their opinion and why they believe thatThe students letters and videos will be graded on two separate rubrics.

One video will bring up the topic of discussion the main crux of this assessment: the fact that by 2050 the United States will become the largest Spanish speaking nation in the world. The video does not go on to propose any solutions or what we as the American people should do about it. The following video however shows a clip of President Donald Trump in a Republican debate saying the quote \u201cWe are in a country where we speak English not Spanish\u201d where the crowd responds with applause. This contrast of opinions currently in the United States on the subject will set the stage for when I will pose the question to the class. What should the United States do when it is the largest Spanish speaking nation in the world? I believe the students will be engaged in the question because of the polarizing effects of President Trump. He stimulates opinions in a majority of people whether they are positive or negative and with his inclusion into an already tantalizing discussion question I believe the students will be very interested and involved in the question and ensuing classwork. \u00a0\u00a0Lesson Main:\u00a0After watching the video the guided research worksheet will be passed out. The students will be given two days of class time to use their devices or the computer lab to research evidence that supports their opinion. They will need to list three of the separate websites visited from which information was gathered. Each source must have all three of the following: author name date of publication and document title If a site is missing any of these things it will not be considered a valid source for them to use. The three criteria must be recorded on the guided research worksheet. \u00a0\u00a0Day 1 & 2: During class the first day I will give them a brief talk about \u2018content farms\u2019 and what sites to watch out for when composing arguments based on factual evidence (i.e Wikipedia LiveStrong Ask). \u00a0Day 3-5: Once those two days of research are done they will then be asked to create a video in small groups of no more than four people all of which must have the same opinions. This video will be about why they believe in what they do and to give at least three facts to support their opinions. These videos will be created during the next three days of class which will start the day I show my example video. I will explain the process of how I made the example video using iMovie. This will include my original recording of just my drawings on a whiteboard putting the clip on to iMovie to adjust the speed of the video recording my voice to match the video and then the combination of the two. The students will be show how to work iMovie record audio record video and then string the two together. The video will be a formative assessment of the cross curriculum learning being done evaluated on it\u2019s own separate rubric. \u00a0\u00a0Lesson Ending:\u00a0Day 6\u00a0Before the final summative assessment is given students will be first asked to share their videos. Students will be encouraged to take notes on each of their classmates videos. They will record information like what their opinion is their three pieces of evidence and their own opinion on if the evidence was worthy enough to convince a total stranger of that opinion. These will all be written down on a separate worksheet given to them. At the end of each video the group or individual will have the opportunity to answer any questions the audience may have about their opinion or their evidence they used to reinforce it. Once all students have done this they will be asked to watch the screencast which I have made for them. This will explain to them how to set up the beginning of a professional letter in both Spanish and English. This professional letter will be the final culminating assessment of the entire project. The students will be tasked with compiling their opinions and evidence having the opportunity to change/alter their evidence or even opinions after viewing videos of other class members into persuasive letters. The letters written by themselves \u00a0will be first drafted in English and focus on explaining the coming situation in 2050 when the United States becomes the largest Spanish speaking nation in the world. They will also explain what they believe should be done about this situation and why citing their research. These letters will be professional and sent to local representatives to Congress; however they will not be sent until they are translated into Spanish and both copies of the letter are in the correct professional layout printed and signed. Afterwards other copies of the letters will be turned in to me and evaluated using another rubric. The day the letters are turned in the class will have a quick anonymous vote (the classic closed eyes raised hands) to show what the class believes should be done: make the US bilingual make English the official language or leave it as is and continue like we have been. Once this decision has been reached the class will come up with their three most important reasons why they believe it should be this way and their decision will also be posted above their letters on the wall. \u00a0Assessment Rubric:\u00a0Video RubricCATEGORY3- Above Standard2- Standard1- Below StandardCreativityThe video was original and showed strong effort was put forthThe video was original and showed some effort was put forthThe video was not original and showed no effort put forth.Use of SourcesSources to back opinions were strong and prevalent through the video.Sources to back opinions were good and semi prevalent through the video.Sources to back opinions were weak and not prevalent through the video.Defined Intro Body and ConclusionThere is a well defined introduction body and conclusion with transitions.There is an introduction body and conclusionThere is no definitive introduction body and conclusion.Logical FlowThe video flows as a whole with one topic leading into the otherThe video goes through multiple different topics yet does not have logical transitions between themThere is no order to the video and it does not follow a logical series of events.\u00a0Letter RubricCATEGORY5 - Exceeds Standards4 - Above Standards3 - Meets Standards2 - Approaching Standards1 - Below StandardsProfesionalismThe letter demonstrates a strong sense of professionalism and respect for the receiver.

These problems may include finding quality sources not having a large enough vocab in Spanish to translate their letter accurately and/or not enough knowledge of conjugations to translate their letters well. If students have trouble finding quality sources I will have a list of my own few sources for each argument. I will point them in the direction of Google searches which should yield at least one of the websites on my list for them to explore. If the students do not feel that they have a large enough vocab in Spanish to translate the letter using words that get the exact point across they want rather than the same general idea I will have Spanish-English dictionaries for the students to use in class or a website which they can use at home. If their knowledge of conjugations is lacking because they have not experienced a certain type of conjugation in Spanish that they are comfortable using in English I will personally step in to explain how the verb should be conjugated in the situation and why."

El Hombre Lobo y Dr\u00e1cula han sido contratados por Universal Missions para investigar si es posible enviar su pr\u00f3ximo explorador planetario a Marte. Ellos quieren poder trabajar al mismo tiempo en los planes pero ya han experimentado ciertos problemas anteriormente al hacer algo similar. Si se rotan por turnos entonces cada uno gastar\u00e1 mucho tiempo esperando a que el otro termine pero si trabajan en sus propias copias e intercambian los cambios por email las cosas se perder\u00e1n se sobreescribir\u00e1n o se duplicar\u00e1n. Un colega sugiere utilizar control de versiones para lidiar con el trabajo. El control de versiones es mejor que el intercambio de ficheros por email: Nada se pierde una vez que se incluye bajo control de versiones a no ser que se haga un esfuerzo sustancial. Como se van guardando todas las versiones precedentes de los ficheros siempre es posible volver atr\u00e1s en el tiempo y ver exactamente qui\u00e9n escribi\u00f3 qu\u00e9 en un d\u00eda en particular o qu\u00e9 versi\u00f3n de un programa fue utilizada para generar un conjunto de resultados en particular. Como se tienen estos registros de qui\u00e9n hizo qu\u00e9 y en qu\u00e9 momento es posible saber a qui\u00e9n preguntar si se tiene una pregunta en un momento posterior y si es necesario revertir el contenido a una versi\u00f3n anterior de forma similar a como funciona el comando \u201cdeshacer\u201d de los editores de texto. Cuando varias personas colaboran en el mismo proyecto es posible pasar por alto o sobreescribir de manera accidental los cambios hechos por otra persona. El sistema de control de versiones notifica autom\u00e1ticamente a los usuarios cada vez que hay un conflicto entre el trabajo de una persona y la otra. Los equipos no son los \u00fanicos que se benefician del control de versiones: los investigadores independientes se pueden beneficiar en gran medida. Mantener un registro de qu\u00e9 ha cambiado cu\u00e1ndo y por qu\u00e9 es extremadamente \u00fatil para todos los investigadores si alguna vez necesitan retomar el proyecto en un momento posterior (e.g. un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s cuando se ha desvanecido el recuerdo de los detalles)."

Multiple levels of difficulty allow for progressive skill improvement. In the simplest level users estimate the number of small line segments that can fit into a larger line segment. Intermediate and advanced levels offer feature games that explore area of rectangles and circles and volume of spheres and cubes. Related lesson plans and student guides are available for middle school and high school classroom instruction. Editor's Note: When the linear dimensions of an object change by some factor its area and volume change disproportionately: area in proportion to the square of the factor and volume in proportion to its cube. This concept is the subject of entrenched misconception among many adults. This game-like simulation allows kids to use spatial reasoning rather than formulas to construct geometric sense of area and volume.

Hair spray gasoline spray paint -- they are all inhalants and so are lots of other everyday products. Many inhalants have a strong smell. That's why they're called inhalants: Some people inhale the vapors on purpose. Why would anyone do this? Because the chemicals in these vapors can change the way the brain works and those changes can make people feel very happy for a short time. But inhalants can also do harm."

This is a Webquest that I created to be used as a group project in a High School Spanish I class. It is a cultural learning project spanning three weeks for classroom groups composed of four students. Within each group each student will carry out one of four different roles/tasks in preparation for an imaginary trip that the class is going to make to Mexico and Central America. Each group will have the option of choosing to research one of the seven countries included which can accommodate a classroom of up to 28 students under the parameters given. The nice thing about this project is that each group will give a presentation on a different country which will broaden the students' cultural knowledge of Mexico and Central America. This project is intended for high school Spanish students but could also be used for middle school. The only technology needed is a computer projector and an internet connection. \u00a1Que lo disfruten!" "subject": "Languages" "material_type": "Activity/Lab" "level": "High School"}
